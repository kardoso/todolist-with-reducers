This branch already uses Redux and React, to see it from scratch go to the master branch.

# Todo list with reducers

A very simple todo list make to learn Redux concepts of reducers, implementing it from scratch.

Made for study purposes.

Using reducer state and actions to make changes more predictable.

- The page contains a list of todos and goals
- It's possible to add and remove items
- It's possible to mark todo as complete (this adds a line through the todo)
